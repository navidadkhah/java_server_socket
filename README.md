# java_server_socket

This is a simple server socket app with Java as known as server-socket-calculator for calculating the Math operations such as Add, Sub, Mult, Sin, Cos, and so on <br>
Used port 3000 for sending data between server and client. The user can set the input until writes "exit" after that the server is shut down.<br>
Hope to enjoy:)
